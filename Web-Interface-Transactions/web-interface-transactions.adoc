This is a manual to illustrate how to perform a transaction via the node's web interface.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This manual is predicated on using the aliases for both the account and the asset, so please be mindful of that.
====

== Step 1: Access the transactions section

You first have to chose the transactions section of the web interface.
Then you must click on the button that says "Send Coins", as shown in the image below.

=== Filling the Account Field

As shown on the image below, if you type the first letter of the alias of your account, a drop down with the correct value will show up.
If you have more than one account, and they start with the same letter, they will be listed.
Please choose the one that you intend to use for this transaction.

.The Account Field

=== Filling the Asset Field

The same process can be used to fill in the Asset: You type the letter `e` and the drop down will show the asset with the alias `EY`, as shown in the image below.

=== Filling the Address Field

You then fill in the address you want this transaction to be sent to, as shown in the image below.

=== Filling the Amount Field

The next step is to fill the amount that you want this transaction to send, as shown in the image below.

.The Amount Field

Once you fill in the amount field and exit the box, the "Select Fee" slider should update with the calculated fee for this transaction.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on wether you're accessing your node's web interface locally or remotely, the "Select Fee" slider can take different amounts of time to update.
If it doesn't update after about 3 seconds, please try to move it by yourself.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before trying to submit this transaction, please make sure that the "Select Fee" slider has a **NON ZERO** value.
The entire process will fail otherwise.
====

Once all the above steps have been done, you can now click on the "Submit transaction" button.

[NOTE]
====
If for some reason an error about insufficient Gas shows, please try and turn the "Chained Transactions" switch on.

== Step 3: Input Password

Immediately after you press the "Submit transaction" button, you'll be presented with a dialog that informs you of the details of the transaction and asks you for your password, as shown in the image below.

.Password Dialog

You now need to input the password that you set up for the shown account.

If all goes well, you'll be redirect to the Transactions section, where the new transaction will be listed as unconfirmed, as shown in the picture below.
